# excel-to-powerpoint
Pull data from an excel spreadsheet and programmatically place the data into a PowerPoint.

In order for this to work you need to have the excel file in the working directory, as well as a copy of the powerpoint you want to use.

Finding the text boxes in the power point can be tricky, here are the docs for python-pptx https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
here also are the docs for openpyxl https://realpython.com/openpyxl-excel-spreadsheets-python/
